SATIVA v0.9-41-gcd9a623, released on 2016-01-28. Last version: https://github.com/amkozlov/sativa 
By A.Kozlov and J.Zhang, the Exelixis Lab. Based on RAxML 8.2.3 by A.Stamatakis.

SATIVA was called as follows:

*** STEP 1: Building the reference tree using provided alignment and taxonomic annotations ***

=> Loading taxonomy from file: /gpfs/work/pr58te/di68joy/mislabels/data/slv123_type/sativa_in.tax.genus ...

==> Loading reference alignment from file: /gpfs/work/pr58te/di68joy/mislabels/data/slv123_type/sativa_in.phy ...

===> Validating taxonomy and alignment ...

====> Building a multifurcating tree from taxonomy with 11939 seqs ...

=====> Building the reference alignment ...

======> Saving the outgroup for later re-rooting ...

=======> Resolving multifurcation: choosing the best topology from 10 independent RAxML runs ...

========> Calling RAxML-EPA to obtain branch labels ...

=========> Post-processing the EPA tree (re-rooting, taxonomic labeling etc.) ...

==========> Saving the reference JSON file: /gpfs/work/pr58te/di68joy/mislabels/jobs/slv123_type/slv123_type-thorough-N10.refjson

*** STEP 2: Searching for mislabels ***

Running the leave-one-sequence-out test...

Leave-one-out test identified 279 suspicious sequences; running final EPA test to check them...

Mislabeled sequences by rank:
Phylum      :	4
Class       :	1
Order       :	17
Family      :	29
Genus       :	165

Total mislabels: 216 / 1.81 %
